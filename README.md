# Sorting
- Performs empirical analysis between **merge sort** and **insertion sort** given the test cases below

## Test Cases

Array of integers with size of 1k, 10k, 100k, and 1m with the following arrangements:
- Randomly ordered
- Ascending order
- Descending order

## Usage
1. Clone this repository

2. In the repository's directory, compile and run the source files. 
```
gcc sorting.c insertionSort.c mergeSort.c -o main
./main
```

3. Choose the sorting algorithm you would like the test.

3. You will see the log output in the `output/log_text.txt` file.

4. Change the file input and output in `sorting.c` to try other test cases.
